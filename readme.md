## cadpi
just the stl files for [carpi](https://github.com/trig0n/carpi)<br>
these are made for the 130x30mm slot of a ford fiesta ja8; which is located under the radio.<br>

### faq:
Q: which stl's should i print?<br>
A: use the folder 'stl/final/'; that's my current setup <br>
<br>
Q: why do keep the folders 'stl/v*'?<br>
A: so i can look back on how bad i was at cad<br> 
<br>
Q: why is there a 99-calibration.conf in 'stl/v1/'?<br>
A: the first version had the screen be horizontal.<br>
turning the screen did't turn the input axis of the touchscreen<br>
copying that file to /usr/share/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ would fix this issue<br>
